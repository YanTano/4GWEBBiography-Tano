            <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
        
              <p>I'm Carlo Tano I am a second year student at the Center for Industrial Technology and Enterprise pursuing a Diploma in Computer Engineering. My long-term aim is to earn a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering as well as a Commercial Pilot License. Most relevant I've been working on is Vivamus a fundraising web page & applying in free flight trainings. At CITE we have also worked on projects involving the development of various e-commerce websites. I had experienced in developing projects using various programming languages such as Java, PHP, etc. as well as with a number of programming tools such as MYSQL, Adobe Photoshop, C# and also with HTML/CSS. I believe in saying "As much as the world fails you, never regret having a good heart". My tale follows: This is my fourth life chance. I'm looking forward to spend it something significant. At my young age I got hospitalized for abrasion in head & dengue fever. The third was this past 4 years I was diagnosed in kidney disease, gal stone and pulmonary and gastrointestinal tuberculosis. I saw no reason to give up God save me that day even my bills. Are you still intrigued about the fourth? My crush just simply holding my hand. Kidding!. Anyway, I spend my free time praying and spending time with my family. I am now seeking for new challenges after this semester, and hopes to work as a web developer.
